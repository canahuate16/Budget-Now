## Project Description
* Web application that allows the user to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. The application uses a graph that updates on real time to illustrate the current status of the user's budget. When entering transactions offline, it will populate the total when internet connection has been regained.
## User Story
* AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling.

## Installation Instructions
* npm install for all dependencies.

## Business Context

Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.
